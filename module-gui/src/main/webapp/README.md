# OcrSelector JavaScript app

This document will get you started when you want to make changes to the ocrselector Goobi plugin JavaScript part.

You will need nodejs and npm installed to build this project. WIth both installed, you just need to run (from the fontend-dev folder):

```
npm install
npm run build
```

`grunt` builds the application and copies it to the correct folder in `/opt/digiverso/goobi/`.
